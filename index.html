        <h2>Saw-scaled Viper (Echis carinatus)</h2>
        <img src="/new image/Saw_Scaled_ViperEchis_carinatus_carinatus_Satara_Maharashtra_India.jpg" alt="image of Saw scaled Viper">
        <p>The Viper creates a raspy sound, much like tiny a saw, in the process of its movement. Saw-scaled vipers are nocturnal but can be seen basking during cold weather. Vipers prefer to crawl in a sidewise manner. They feed on small rodents, mammals, invertebrates such as scorpions and centipede. They have hemotoxic venom just like most of the vipers.</p>

        <h2>Common Krait (Bungarus caeruleus)</h2>
        <img src="/new image/common-krait-indian-one-most-260nw-1245852457.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The Krait's binomial name is derived from the Telugu word ‘bangaru’ meaning krait. Caeruleus is Latin for the colour 'dark blue' due too the shine on the skin of the snake. The Common Krait is active and aggressive during night time, while on other hand during day time they are much docile. Common Kraits eat other snakes, as well as rodents, frogs, toads etc. A Krait's bite delivers venom that is neurotoxic just like that of the cobra and acts on the nervous system of the victim. </p>

        <h2>Spectacled Cobra (Naja naja):</h2>
        <img src="/new image/download.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Binomial name of the cobra is derived from Naya meaning cobra in the Sinhalese language. The cobra is worshipped in may culture and very few allow the killing of the cobra. On the Nag Panchami festival in India, the cobra is offered milk and sweetmeat. When provoked, cobras lift the front part of the body up to a third of the total body length. They show their hood which has marks which are different for each cobra just like strips on tigers.</p>

        <h2>Russell’s Viper (Daboia russelii):</h2>
        <img src="/new image/download (1).jpg" alt="Russel's Viper">
        <p>Named after a Scottish herpetologist, Patrick Russell, who has helped explain and identify many snakes from India, Russell's Viper is mainly nocturnal and are in the top list of human-snake conflict. They have the heat-sensing pits just below the nostrils, which acts as an infrared vision for the snake in the darkness. They have the longest fangs which can grow up to 16 mm. The Russell’s viper’s hiss is among the loudest hiss of the snakes in our country. They have the hemotoxic venom which acts on the blood cells, tissues and muscles on the victim. The main prey of these snakes is rodents.</p>
